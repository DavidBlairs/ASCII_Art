# ASCII Art
This project allows you to create ASCII Art using python. For example, you can take this picture of the front of a building:
![img_front_of_school-1000x540](https://github.com/DavidBlairs/ASCII_Art/assets/54111529/baeed792-7d36-4dde-a3ee-2ca42dc7733b)

And convert it into ASCII art (might take a second to load):
![asciiArtFile](https://github.com/DavidBlairs/ASCII_Art/assets/54111529/49e26210-4e3b-4252-b769-94b56f496044)

And also create colour versions of the image in 
ASCII art (might take a second to load):
